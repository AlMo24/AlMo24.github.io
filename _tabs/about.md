#Yeah.. Kinda forgot to update this page.. :D  
First of all, thanks for visiting! I hope you'll find something useful here.

This blog was originally intended to be a subdomain of my website, serving as a guide to document how I built the entire site. It's primarily for my own reference, a personal record of what I've learned and done, rather than a platform for engagement. That's why I haven't included a comment section on each post. If you have questions, feel free to shoot me an email or send me a direct message on my social media.

In addition to this blog, I plan to create dashboards as the main feature of this site. These dashboards will showcase my mini projects, displaying how they look and their respective results. If anyone is interested, they can use these as references for their own projects. I’m also considering a page where I’ll recommend courses, stores, and vendors that provide the tools and materials I use in my projects. Staying true to the site’s motto, I’ll take this one step at a time.

My projects mostly revolve around low-budget systems, relying on open-source software and free-tier services. This isn’t just due to my current financial constraints; I also want to demonstrate that you don’t need high-end, multi-core servers in a multi-racks systems housed in data centers to meet your needs—whether for personal use, family, or even a small business.

**About me?**

Well, I’m an engineer. I graduated from ITS Surabaya with a degree in Physics, majoring in Instrumentation. My whole career has primarily revolved around working with machines across various industries—from television broadcasting to telecommunications, and more.

The common thread in all these industries? *Service time is of the absolute essence*.

That’s why you might notice that my projects often emphasize best practices, particularly in security and failure mitigation. I’m passionate about building systems that are not only functional but also robust and reliable.
